```

## Real AI processing

The video localization pipeline (transcription, translation, TTS, AI avatar
generation, lip-sync) is real, backed by Supabase + Gemini + Replicate — but
requires you to create your own accounts and API keys first. See
[PHASE3_SETUP.md](./PHASE3_SETUP.md) for the full setup checklist. Until
that's done, the app runs in a safe "not configured" mode rather than
crashing.
